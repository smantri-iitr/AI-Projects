- **Generation Speed**: <1 second per 100 characters
- **Text Quality**: Coherent continuations with proper grammar

### 🚀 Advanced Usage

#### **Custom Training Data**
Replace sample texts with your own data:
```python
custom_texts = ["Your custom text here", "More text data"]
X, y = generator.preprocess_text(custom_texts)
```

#### **Model Persistence**
Save and load trained models:
```python
# Save model
generator.model.save('my_lstm_model.h5')

# Load model
generator.model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_lstm_model.h5')
```

#### **Real-time Generation**
Generate text interactively:
```python
while True:
    seed = input("Enter seed text: ")
    generated = generator.generate_text(seed, length=50, temperature=0.8)
    print(f"Generated: {generated}")
```

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

#### **Common Issues**
1. **Memory Errors**: Reduce batch size or sequence length
2. **Slow Training**: Use GPU acceleration or reduce model complexity
3. **Poor Text Quality**: Increase training epochs or improve training data
4. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed

#### **Performance Optimization**
- Use GPU acceleration with TensorFlow
- Reduce model complexity for faster training
- Implement batch processing for large datasets
- Use mixed precision training for memory efficiency
